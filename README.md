This repository contains a Django web app developed as part of my Research Project/Third Year Project at Dorset College BSc in Computing, Year 3, Semester 2.

## Part 1: Requirements and Setup

**Framework:** this project requires installation of both [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/).

**Database engine:** it also requires access to a database through an user with enough privileges to create new tables and manipulate the data therein ([see docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/databases/)). The project is currently set to work with [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/), but switching to another supported backend should be an easy fix.

**Migration:** it is necessary to tell Django to create the tables in the database from the models defined in the project. On a terminal window at the project's root directory:

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

**Fixture:** once the tables are created, it is possible to populate them with predefined data to start playing with the app right away. The project contains the file */fixtures/data.json*, which is a fixture, a JSON object that tells Django what data to use to populate the tables in the database. On the terminal:

    python manage.py loaddata data.json

**Packages:** since the application relies on a number of third-party packages, their installation can be automated. The project contains the file /requirements.txt, that cen be read by pip to have all packages installed at once. On the terminal:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Part 2: Background

The aim of this project was to develop a web application that makes use of computer vision to assist nanotechnologists in calculating the size distribution of nanoparticle populations by automating the analysis of images obtained via TEM and reducing human intervention, thus quickening the characterization process and increasing its reliability by removing an error-prone step.

## Part 3: Breakdown

This project was developed based on the web framework Django and its MVT design pattern. The following scheme explains the organization of its main components:

- **1. Models**
  - ```mermaid
    erDiagram

          datetime created_at "The timestamp of the project's creation"
          datetime updated_at "The timestamp of the project's last update"
          int user_id FK "The id of the user that owns the project"
      }
    ```
  - ```mermaid
    erDiagram
      ANALYSIS {
          int id PK "The id of the analysis"
          string title "The title of the analysis"
          string description "The description of the analysis"
          datetime created_at "The timestamp of the analysis' creation"
          int project_id FK "The id of the project that owns the analysis"
      }
    ```
  - ```mermaid
    erDiagram
      FILE {
          int id PK "The id of the file"
          string title "The title of the file"
          string uri "The file's location on the server"
          string type "The file's type ('image' or 'data')"
          int source_id FK "The id of the file on which the analysis was based"
          int analysis_id FK "The id of the analysis that owns the file"
      }
    ```
