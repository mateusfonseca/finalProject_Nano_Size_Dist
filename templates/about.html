    <h4>
        <q>automated teeny-tiny-tally</q> (atÂ³) is a web app developed as part of my Research Project/Third Year Project
        at Dorset College BSc in
        Computing, Year 3, Semester 2.

    <h4 class="text-start">Background</h4>
    <br>
    <h5 class="text-start">
        The aim of this project was to develop a web application that makes use of computer vision to assist
        nanotechnologists in calculating the size distribution of nanoparticle populations by automating the
        analysis of images obtained via TEM and reducing human intervention, thus quickening the
        characterization process and increasing its reliability by removing an error-prone step.

        Input
        <br><br>
        As of now, the application only accepts TIFF files. The uploaded file must be in a very specific visual format
        so that the algorithm can infer the scaling factor when converting from pixels to nanometers by analyzing the
        legend separated from the actual micrograph. You can download a dummy file <a href="{% static 'nanoer/images/dummy_tem_format.tif' %}" download="dummy_tem_format.tif">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        Output
        <br><br>
        The results of each analysis are comprised of four files: the original TIFF image file uploaded by the user; the
        processed image file with the outlined identified nanoparticles, in PNG format; a 3-axis graph with the size
        distribution of the sample represented as both a histogram and a KDE plot; and a CSV file containing the x and y
        coordinates of the center of each nanoparticle, as well as their calculated diameters, in nanometers.
        <br><br>
        User accounts
        <br><br>
        You do not need an account to run as many analysis as you want. After every run, you will have the option to
        download all the artifacts in a ZIP file. That said, users can also create accounts, which allow them
        to create project folders on the server and store/access the results of their analysis remotely. Any stored
        analysis and even whole projects can be downloaded at any time.
